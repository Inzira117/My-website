          My journey into software development started with a love for creating
          things and a curiosity for how technology works.After years in sales,
          I decided to follow my passion for problem-solving and began learning
          web development. Now, as a full stack developer, I combine technical
          skills with creativity to craft user-focused digital experiences.
          Every project is a new opportunity to learn, adapt, and grow.
